This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.0.

### Getting Started

- Setup the environment, if not already configured:
  - Install NodeJS: [go/nodejs/installing-node](http://go/nodejs/installing-node)
  - Install the Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

- Fetch the app dependencies, run: `npm install`

### Running locally

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

With that process running, the application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
